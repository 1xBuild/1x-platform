# Security Guideline Document for thep33l

## 1. Introduction & Purpose
This document outlines security best practices and requirements for **thep33l**, a full-stack platform enabling marketing teams to configure, deploy, and manage AI agents. It translates core security principles into actionable guidelines tailored to our tech stack and project workflows. Adhering to these guidelines will help us build a resilient, trustworthy application by design.

## 2. Core Security Principles
- **Security by Design**: Embed security reviews in every sprint, design session, and code review.  
- **Least Privilege**: Grant services, processes, and users only the permissions they strictly need.  
- **Defense in Depth**: Rely on multiple overlapping controls (network, application, data layers).  
- **Fail Securely**: On error, avoid leaking internal details; default to deny.  
- **Keep Security Simple**: Favor simple, well-understood mechanisms over complex custom solutions.  
- **Secure Defaults**: All new features and configurations ship with the most restrictive settings enabled.

## 3. Authentication & Access Control
### 3.1 Admin Authentication (v1 & Roadmap)
- **v1 Hardcoded Credentials**: Limit to internal, non-production environments only. Clearly flag this as temporary.  
- **v2+ Production-Ready**:
  - Implement JWT-based sessions or OAuth2/OIDC.  
  - Enforce strong password policies (min. 12 chars, complexity) when moving beyond hardcoded creds.  
  - Support Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for admin accounts.

### 3.2 Session Management
- Issue cryptographically unpredictable session tokens.  
- Set `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Strict` for session cookies.  
- Enforce idle and absolute timeouts (e.g., 15 min idle, 8 hr absolute).  
- Invalidate sessions on logout or password change.

### 3.3 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Define roles: `Admin`, `User`, `BotService`, etc.  
- Enforce server-side checks on every sensitive endpoint (`/api/agent`, `/api/tools`, `/api/triggers`).  
- Reject requests lacking appropriate role claims.

## 4. Input Handling & Data Validation
- Treat all inputs (HTTP bodies, query params, headers, files) as untrusted.  
- Use a validation library (e.g., Zod, Joi) to define strict schemas for every API request.  
- Implement context-aware output encoding to prevent XSS in rendered UIs.  
- Sanitize HTML inputs or disable rich text fields unless absolutely needed.  
- Validate redirect URLs against a white-list.  
- For file uploads (if any):
  - Check MIME types and file extensions.  
  - Set maximum file size limits.  
  - Store uploads outside the web root and scan for malware.

## 5. API & Service Security
### 5.1 Transport Security
- Enforce HTTPS/TLS (minimum TLS 1.2) for all client-server and inter-service communications.  
- Enable HSTS (`Strict-Transport-Security` header).

### 5.2 Rate Limiting & Throttling
- Apply IP-based and user-based rate limits on authentication and AI endpoints to mitigate brute-force and DoS.  
- Implement exponential backoff on repeat failures.

### 5.3 CORS & CSRF Protection
- Configure CORS to allow only the specific admin frontend origin.  
- Use anti-CSRF tokens for state-modifying endpoints or require custom headers (e.g., `X-Requested-With`).

### 5.4 API Versioning & Principle of Least Exposure
- Prefix endpoints with versions (`/api/v1/agent`).  
- Return only necessary fieldsâ€”avoid exposing internal IDs or database schemas.

## 6. Bot Integration Security (Discord & Telegram)
- Store bot tokens in a secrets vault or environment variables (never in source).  
- Restrict bot permissions to only necessary scopes (message read/send).  
- Validate and sanitize user messages before forwarding to agents.  
- Rate-limit outgoing bot messages to respect platform policies.  
- Handle malformed or malicious payloads gracefully.

## 7. Data Protection & Encryption
- **At Rest**:
  - Encrypt SQLite files at the filesystem level or migrate to an encrypted database (e.g., PostgreSQL with TDE).  
- **In Transit**: All network traffic over TLS.  
- **Sensitive Fields**:
  - Never store plaintext API keys or PII.  
  - Consider field-level encryption or hashing (e.g., Argon2 for passwords, HMAC for integrity checks).

## 8. Secrets & Configuration Management
- Use a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) for production API keys and DB credentials.  
- Keep `.env.example` in the repo; never commit real secrets.  
- Rotate secrets periodically and on staff changes.

## 9. Infrastructure & Deployment Security
- Harden server OS and container images: disable unused services, remove default accounts.  
- Expose only necessary ports (e.g., 443 for HTTPS, none for database if behind a VPN).  
- Use up-to-date, CIS-benchmarked Docker/base images.  
- Disable debug/flamegraph endpoints in production.  
- Automate security updates for OS and dependencies via CI/CD or tooling (e.g., Dependabot).

## 10. Dependency Management
- Vet third-party libraries for maintenance activity and known vulnerabilities before adoption.  
- Enforce lockfiles (`pnpm-lock.yaml`) and run automated SCA scans (e.g., GitHub Dependabot or Snyk).  
- Minimize dependency footprint: remove or replace unused packages.

## 11. Security Testing & Monitoring
- Integrate static analysis (ESLint security plugins) and dynamic scanning (OWASP ZAP) in CI.  
- Write unit and integration tests covering input validation, auth flows, and error handling.  
- Deploy application logging with structured logs; exclude sensitive fields.  
- Monitor logs and set alerts on suspicious activity (e.g., repeated auth failures, burst of API calls).  
- Conduct periodic security reviews and penetration tests.

## 12. Incident Response & Future Enhancements
- Define an incident response plan: roles, communication channels, and recovery steps.  
- Maintain a CVE tracking process; schedule quarterly dependency updates.  
- Plan v2 improvements:
  - Full RBAC with dynamic roles.  
  - MFA, SSO integrations.  
  - Migration from SQLite to a robust, horizontally scalable DB.  
  - Automated secrets rotation.
